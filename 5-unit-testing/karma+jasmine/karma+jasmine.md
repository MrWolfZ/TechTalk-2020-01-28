## Karma + Jasmine

### Highlights

- big community (mostly due to being bundled with Angular)
- test your app in multiple browsers

### Lowlights

- no support for parallel testing
- no test isolation
- pollutes global namespace
- difficult to debug infrastructure issues
- only for frontend

### Use when:

- you are using Angular
- you want to ensure your app works consistently across many browsers
- you don't want to get on Buddha's bad side
