## Jest

### Highlights

- big community (mostly due to being developed by Facebook for React)
- isolated & parallel test execution
- module mocking
- test only what changed since last commit
- easy to debug in your IDE
- snapshot testing
- excellent assertion output

### Lowlights

- no direct support for parameterized tests
- pollutes global namespace
- tests run in emulated browser environment (i.e. jsdom)

### Use when:

- you are using React
- you have many tests
- your ancestors owned a circus
