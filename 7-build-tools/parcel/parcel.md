## Webpack

### Highlights

- default configuration works for many projects
- supports all kinds of assets out of the box
- fast
- autoinstall

### Lowlights

- if zero config does not work, configuration can be just as complex as other build tools
- debugging can be tricky

### Use when:

- you want something that often just works out of the box
- you are not using Angular
- you have worked for Amazon before
