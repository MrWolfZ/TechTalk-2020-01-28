## Elm

### Highlights

- staticically typed, preventing runtime exceptions
- functional programming (e.g. expressive type system, pattern matching etc.)
- the "Elm Architecture"
- generated JavaScript is very fast
- enforced semantic versioning for libraries

### Lowlights

- syntax is unfamiliar for many developers
- compilation takes time
- only few people use it -> small ecosystem

### Use when:

- you have a team of Haskell or F# programmers
- your team is used to statically typed languages
- TypeScript is just not edgy enough for you
