## Puppeteer

### Highlights

- isolated installation (e.g. no external drivers required)
- full access to Chrome APIs/dev tools (e.g. analyzing network traffic etc.)
- fast
- screenshots (PDF, images)
- support for many languages through community libraries

### Lowlights

- only Chrome
- not really a testing framework, just browser automation
- less abstraction over the browser

### Use when:

- you are mainly targeting Chrome
- you want to run advanced analysis that requires low-level APIs (e.g. performance testing)
- you liked playing with sock puppets as a child
