## Selenium/Protractor

### Highlights

- large community
- supports all kinds of browsers
- selenium grid
- cloud offerings
- client libraries for many different languages

### Lowlights

- not the most stable tool (e.g. browser instance left hanging open)
- often requires many waits, which leads to slow tests
- browser drivers are of differing quality

### Use when:

- you are using Angular
- you want to test your UI across multiple browsers
- you have an existing investment in Selenium infrastructure
